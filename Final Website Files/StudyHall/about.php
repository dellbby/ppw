            <h7>Studyhall was created by a group of friends while studying in a coffee shop in 2016. They got tired of the location they kept going to and realized they couldn't go to a central website to find places to study. This is when they created studyhall. Studyhall is expanding everyday and new locations are constantly being added. We are open to adding your business so please submit your location and we will check it out!
            <Br><BR>
            Our company is based in Los Angeles, CA and we currently have a team of 5. We are not hiring at the moment, but will be as our company expands. Our team looks for only the best locations to add to our site. We like to have a variety of options for people to search because not everyone has the same wants and needs for the place they want to study.
