      <h6> Q: How can I submit locations for Review?</h6>
      A: To submit locations, you must first create an account. After creating your account, under "My Account" click on "Submit a location." You will not be notified whether or not your location has been approved, so please check back. Locations take up to 30 days for approval or disapproval.
